# Hackernews
This project is the clone of the famous website Hackernews. It's nothing sort of fancy project.
This project is made by me to practice my **React js**, **Redux** and **webpack** skills. I have written all the webpack configs from the scratch.

I have used **immer js** in it to maintain the immutability property.

To run this project locally:

Run **yarn install** or **npm install**.
Run **yarn dev** or **npm run dev**
